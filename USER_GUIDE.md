```
INFO:     Started server process [10752]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

#### 3.2 Start Web Interface
Open a **NEW terminal** and run:
```bash
streamlit run web_interface.py
```

**Expected Output:**
```
You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.
Local URL: http://localhost:8501
Network URL: http://192.168.0.101:8501
```

### **Phase 4: Test the System**

#### 4.1 Test via Web Interface
1. Open your browser
2. Go to: **http://localhost:8501**
3. You'll see the web interface
4. Try asking: "What is my total sales?"

#### 4.2 Test via Command Line
Open a **third terminal** and run:
```bash
python test_agent.py
```

#### 4.3 Test Individual Questions
```bash
# Test the three required questions
python -c "
import requests
questions = [
    'What is my total sales?',
    'Calculate the RoAS (Return on Ad Spend).',
    'Which product had the highest CPC (Cost Per Click)?'
]
for q in questions:
    response = requests.post('http://localhost:8000/ask', json={'question': q})
    print(f'Q: {q}')
    print(f'A: {response.json()[\"response\"]}')
    print('---')
"
```

## üåê Access Points

Once running, you can access:

| Service | URL | Description |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| **Web Interface** | http://localhost:8501 | Main user interface |
| **API Documentation** | http://localhost:8000/docs | Interactive API docs |
| **Health Check** | http://localhost:8000/health | System status |
| **API Root** | http://localhost:8000 | API information |

## üß™ Example Questions to Test

### Required Questions (for assignment):
1. **"What is my total sales?"**
2. **"Calculate the RoAS (Return on Ad Spend)."**
3. **"Which product had the highest CPC (Cost Per Click)?"**

### Additional Questions:
- "How many products are eligible for advertising?"
- "What is the total ad spend across all products?"
- "Which products have the highest impressions?"
- "What is the average cost per click?"
- "How many units were sold from advertising?"

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

#### 1. "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'plotly'"
```bash
pip install plotly kaleido streamlit
```

#### 2. "Cannot connect to API server"
- Make sure the API server is running: `python api_server.py`
- Check if port 8000 is available

#### 3. "UnicodeEncodeError"
- The system now uses text-based indicators instead of emojis
- Should work on all systems

#### 4. "API Key Error"
- Make sure you've added your API key to the `.env` file
- Verify the key is correct and complete

#### 5. "Database Error"
```bash
python database_setup.py
```

### Port Conflicts:
If ports 8000 or 8501 are in use:
- Change ports in `api_server.py` (line with `uvicorn.run`)
- Change ports in `web_interface.py` (line with `streamlit run`)

## üì± Windows Users - Easy Start

### Using Batch Files:
1. **Double-click** `start_system.bat` to start API server
2. **Double-click** `start_web_interface.bat` to start web interface
3. Open browser to **http://localhost:8501**

### Using PowerShell:
```powershell
# Start API server
.\start_system.bat

# Start web interface (new window)
.\start_web_interface.bat
```

## üéØ Demo Mode (No API Key Required)

If you want to test without getting an API key:
```bash
python demo.py
```

This shows how the system works with sample responses.
